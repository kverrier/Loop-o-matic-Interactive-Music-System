The Loop-o-matic is an interactive musical “instrument” inspired by a design by David Wessel ([Cool Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_mtCZqN0Ms). The instrument generates MIDI notes that repeat, with interactive control over therepetition rate, pitch, velocity, duration, channel, and program. Unlike most drum machines, this program allows different drums or notes to play at different rates, creating interesting musical patterns and textures.

To use open the jar file and interact with GUI.
